# How much time did you spend on the assignment?

### about 21 hours:

* Sat -- 3 hours

* Sun -- 5 hours

* Mon -- 5 hours

* Wed -- 2 + 6 hours

# Is your solution fully working or not? Briefly describe design decisions and class structure.

## design decisions: 

* simple random number generated to invert indices

- Because Sequence implements invert(), it's the proper class to encapsulate int i for abstract Inverter class.

## class structure:

* Sequence is-an Inverter (extends Inverter),

* Repeater, Extractor, and Variator each is-a Sequence (extends Sequence)

# Did you work on the extra credit problem? Briefly describe any issues or explain any assumptions made.

# Any feedback on the assignment?
